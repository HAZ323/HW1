##CSE 264 – Web Systems Programming, Spring 2023
## Homework Assignment 1
## Creating a Personal Website Using HTML and CSS
## Due Tuesday, January 31, 2023


## Purpose

To get some experience using basic HTML and CSS.


## Overview

Create a personal web site for a Lehigh student – it could be yourself or a fictional student you have created (yes, humor is definitely allowed). You’re encouraged to be creative.

## Instructions

1. Install a good code editor on your laptop. You cannot create web pages in a word processor (like Google Docs). Visual Studio Code is highly recommended (https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Create a text file named index.html in Visual Studio Code. Create a skeleton html page (doctype, html, head, body elements) in the text file and include an html comment at the top of the page with your name, email, class number and assignment number/name. Do a git commit and push.
3. Put a title element in the head with the title of your site. Include whatever text you want to be displayed in the browser tab when this page is opened.
4. Create a style element in the head for your styles.
5. Create a div element in the body and give it an id attribute of “container”. All the content of your page will go in this div.
6. Style your web page to be exactly 800 pixels wide. Do this by setting a width style of 800px for the body element.
7. Create 4 divs (one right after the other) within the container div (from step 6). The first div is for the banner at the top of the page, The next 2 are for the 2 columns of content, and the final div is for the footer.
8. The banner should have its background set to an appropriate color (or, if you're feeling ambitious, set a background image) and the name of the person (real or fake). Any other text in the banner is optional.
9. The left column should take up about 2/3 the width of the page and have 4 level 2 headers introducing the following sections:
a) Bio: A brief biography of the person, divided into paragraphs with paragraph elements. Use level 3 headers to divide into Early Life, Life at Lehigh, etc.
b) Favorites: An unordered list of the person's favorites, styled appropriately.
c) Courses: An ordered list of current courses.
d) Music: A table with two columns listing (a few) songs from the person's music collection. Column 1 lists the song and column 2 lists the artist.
10. The right column should have an image of the person at the top of the column.
11. Below the image should be a level 2 header “Fun Facts” with an ordered list of interesting facts about the person.
12. Include a copyright notice in the footer (and anything else you would like to put), centered. Use the proper entity for the copyright symbol. Use a different background color for the footer.
13. Use Gollum.pdf as an example of a good page. It’s content isn’t exactly the same as this assignment but it’s close. 
14. Make sure to commit and push the final version of your page.
